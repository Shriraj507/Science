        <h2>Key Contributions of Aryabhata</h2>

        <h3>1. Place Value System and Decimal System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata was one of the earliest mathematicians to use the <strong>place value system</strong>, the foundation of the modern decimal system. His work laid the groundwork for the widespread use of the concept of zero and the decimal positional system in mathematics.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Approximation of Pi (π)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata approximated the value of pi (π) as <strong>3.1416</strong>, which was remarkably close to the true value. He used a geometric approach and mathematical reasoning to calculate pi, providing an accurate approximation centuries before Western mathematicians.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Sine Function</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata introduced the <strong>sine function</strong> (referred to as "jya") and created a table of sine values for calculating celestial positions. This was a precursor to the trigonometric systems that emerged in the Islamic Golden Age.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Algebra and Indeterminate Equations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata made significant contributions to <strong>algebra</strong>, particularly in solving indeterminate equations (also known as Diophantine equations). His methods for solving these equations were influential in later Indian mathematics.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Pythagorean Theorem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata is believed to have known a form of the <strong>Pythagorean theorem</strong>, relating the sides of a right-angled triangle. His work on right-angled triangles predates the formal proof by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Quadratic Equations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata made early contributions to solving <strong>quadratic equations</strong>, influencing later mathematicians such as Brahmagupta and Bhaskara. His methods were a significant step forward in algebraic techniques.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Series Expansions and Approximations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata developed methods for approximating <strong>series expansions</strong> of mathematical functions like sine and cosine, which would later influence the development of calculus.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Square and Cube Roots</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata made significant contributions to the calculation of <strong>square roots</strong> and <strong>cube roots</strong>, which were crucial for both his astronomical and mathematical work.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9. Solution of Linear Equations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata contributed to solving <strong>linear equations</strong>, and his techniques were refined by later mathematicians such as Brahmagupta and Bhaskara. His work on these equations shaped algebraic traditions in India.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10. Mathematical Precision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Aryabhata's work was known for its <strong>precision</strong>, with methods grounded in a logical understanding of numbers, leading to accurate calculations in both mathematics and astronomy.</p>
